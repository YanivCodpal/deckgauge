# Contributing to Deckgauge

Thanks for your interest in improving **Deckgauge** — the open-source engineering-intelligence platform. Contributions of every kind are welcome: bug reports, features, docs, and fixes.

## Ways to contribute

- 🐛 **Report a bug** — open an issue with clear steps to reproduce.
- ✨ **Propose a feature** — open an issue describing the problem first, then your idea.
- 📖 **Improve the docs** — see [deckgauge.com/docs](https://deckgauge.com/docs).
- 🔧 **Send a pull request** — see the workflow below.

## Development setup

Deckgauge is a **pnpm + Turborepo monorepo** (Next.js web, Fastify API, BullMQ worker, Postgres, Redis, ClickHouse, Keycloak).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YanivCodpal/deckgauge
cd deckgauge
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
# create the database schema
docker compose run --rm api sh -c "cd /app/packages/db && npx prisma db push --skip-generate"
# create the ClickHouse analytics tables
bash scripts/apply-clickhouse-schemas.sh
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000**. Full setup — connecting sources, SSO, access control — is in the [docs](https://deckgauge.com/docs).

For iterating on the code directly: `pnpm install` then `pnpm dev`.

## Before you open a PR

Please make sure these pass:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

- Add tests for new business logic (validators, services, transforms). Tests use **Vitest**.
- Follow the existing style — Prettier (single quotes, 2-space indent, 100-char width); ESLint must pass.
- Update docs when behavior changes.

## Pull request guidelines

- Branch from `main` as `feature/<slug>` or `fix/<slug>`.
- Keep PRs **focused and small**; explain the *what* and the *why*.
- Reference the issue it addresses.

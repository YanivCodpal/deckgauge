//   kind='trend'     — one row per ISO week (or month, config `bucket`),
//                       coverage_pct / comment_pct / sample over merged PRs
//                       cohorted by created_at.
//   kind='scorecard' — the Phase-1 five review-quality KPIs for the whole
//                       window (identical output to review-quality-index.ts).
//
// Reuses Phase-1's per-PR flag CTEs (github PRs⋈github_reviews, ado PRs⋈
// ado_reviews; peer-approval + peer-comment flags) via the same all_prs UNION
// ALL. Returns null when the board has no github/ado scope.

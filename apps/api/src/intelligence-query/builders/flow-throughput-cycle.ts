// "Scissors" widget: bars = items delivered/period, line = median cycle time.
//
// Done-date source per the plan: Jira resolved_at is frequently NULL, so the
// Jira leg uses jira_transitions (first done transition per issue) INNER JOINed
// to jira_issues FINAL for created_at — mirroring ch-completion-trend.ts's
// done-date source. Done-ness is matched on the status *name* (to_status IN
// DONE_STATUS_NAMES), NOT to_category: the Jira changelog carries no category,
// so jira_transitions.to_category is always 'Unknown' (see status-rules.ts).
// ADO has no such gap: closed_at on ado_work_items directly reflects the done
// transition.
//
// Bulk-close guard (ref: Acme "345-day June" cleanup): items whose
// created→done span exceeds {maxAgeDays} are excluded from the cycle-time
// median and flag their period instead, so a mass historical-import close
// doesn't blow out the median or silently understate cycle time.

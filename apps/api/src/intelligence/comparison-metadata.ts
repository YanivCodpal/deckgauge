// P6 — Comparability metadata for multi-board comparison widgets.
//
// When a VP lines up teams that live on different boards, some metrics are
// apples-to-apples across those boards and some are not. Rate/duration metrics
// (review coverage %, cycle time, comment rate) are self-normalising and stay
// comparable. Raw counts (issues delivered, PRs merged) and PR-size buckets are
// NOT comparable once the board set mixes issue/PR providers, because Jira and
// ADO count and slice work differently (squash vs merge commits, story vs task
// granularity, XS-heavy PR-size skew). The web layer greys the non-comparable
// cells so the reader never misreads e.g. Acme's raw PR count against a
// squash-only ADO team.
//
// A per-capita metric (a count divided by effective-developer headcount) is
// comparable ONLY when every board in the set has a resolvable org-tree link;
// a board with no org roster has no denominator and is flagged instead of
// silently dividing by the raw member list.

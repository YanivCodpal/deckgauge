# Deckgauge

### Open-source development intelligence — one board across all your dev tools.

*See how your software really gets built.*

Turn **Jira, GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps** into one board with the widgets, dashboards,
rankings, and roadmaps engineering leaders use to see what’s really going on.

## See it in action

### One board across all your dev tools

Pull Jira, GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps into a single Monday-style board — grouped,
owned, status-tracked, sized, and classified CapEx/OpEx. Discuss any item inline.

![Deckgauge board — owners, status, effort sizing, CapEx/OpEx classification, and inline item comments](https://deckgauge.com/media/board.gif)

### Auto-generated roadmaps

Timelines built straight from live board data — parallel lanes per team, effort-sized bars,
and a today line.

### Org chart & team structure

Import your org from CSV/Excel (or sync your directory) — a live reporting tree, per-team
boards, and private 1:1 / review notes on every person.

dashboard, the ranking leaderboard, and CapEx/OpEx reporting.

## ⚡ Install with your AI agent — one line

Paste this into your AI coding agent (**Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot agent**, or any agent
that can run commands). It fetches the setup skill and installs Deckgauge on your machine:

```
curl -fsSL https://deckgauge.com/install.md
```

That’s it — the agent clones the repo, starts the stack, runs migrations, and hands you back
`http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Install it yourself (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YanivCodpal/deckgauge
cd deckgauge
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
# apply migrations, then open http://localhost:3000
docker compose run --rm api sh -c "cd /app/packages/db && npx prisma migrate deploy"
```

Full setup — connecting sources, SSO, access control — is in the [docs](https://deckgauge.com/docs).

## What you get

- **📊 Monitoring & visibility** — DORA, flow, throughput, review time, WIP as widgets you watch, centralized across all four tools.
- **🏆 Automatic ranking** — rank contributors by PRs, tickets, commits, and review comments (weights you choose) to find your champions; org-tree badges for delivery streaks and who’s gone quiet.
- **🗂️ Alignment dashboards** — pull imported issues into one board for leadership meetings: comment conclusions, re-prioritize, set due dates, resync for live status.
- **🛣️ Auto-generated roadmaps** — timelines built from live board data, with progress and a today line.
- **💰 CapEx / OpEx for finance** — audit-ready software capitalization, inferred from activity, no manual timesheets.
- **👥 Team management & reviews** — dated, private notes so 1:1s and performance reviews are grounded in real examples.

Open source. Multi-tool. No lock-in. Read the queries, run it yourself, trust the numbers.
